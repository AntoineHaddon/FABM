This is a GOTM 4.1 (developers version 2010-2-11) scenario for the Black Sea

Meteo data for 1980-2002 was taken from the ERA-40 dataset, for 34 East, 43 North. Precipitation values are based on the ERA-40 precipitation, but with an added 0.41 m/year chosen to (nearly) close the freshwater budget. Presumely, this additional freshwater input accounts for river input, among others.

Temperature profiles were provided by Baris Salihoglu, and have been compiled from CTD data.

Light extinction is constant in time, and set to a shortwave radiation fraction of 38% (common), an extinction length of 10 m for the shortwave fraction (suggested by Baris Salihoglu), and 0.5 m for the longwave fraction (close to the 0.40 m for Lago Maggiore, but increased to account for the shorter Lago Maggiore shortwave extinction length of 8 m)
