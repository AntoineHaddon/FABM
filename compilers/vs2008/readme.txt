This directory contains the Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 solution that builds both the GOTM exectuable
and the 0-dimensional biogeochemical driver driver on Windows.

For this to work, you will need to have both Visual Studio 2008 and the Intel Visual Fortran Compiler
installed. The latter integrates with Visual Studio, provided you have a suitable version (at least
the IVFC versions 10 to 11 support integration with VS 2008).

To start, open "gotm.sln" - the main solution file.
